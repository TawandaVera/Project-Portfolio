
This project is built on Windows 10 Pro(64Bit) using Spyder 3.1.4 IDLE  and Python 3.6.1


Install Python 3.6.(Installed Python from source, with an installer from python.org, or via Homebrew which should already have pip)

If pip isn’t already installed, then first try to bootstrap it from the standard library: python -m ensurepip --default-pip

Install matplotlib which will come with numpy and scipy (pip install matplotlib)

Install pandas_datareader (pip install pandas_datareader)


then run MiniProject2.py

The Solution design is in Solution Design.docx

The output files run on my computer are in the miniproject2output.html
